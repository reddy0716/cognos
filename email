Hi [Manager],

While working on the MotioCI deployment pipeline, I noticed that our Jenkins credential prod-credentials-json only contains the PROD API key.

For a DEV→PRD promotion, MotioCI expects the authentication token to have read access on the source (DEV/TEST) and write access on the target (PRD). If the PROD service account doesn’t have access to DEV/TEST, we may need:

Either to grant the PROD account cross-instance permissions (preferred – simpler, one token), or

To maintain a separate DEV credential in Jenkins and switch between the two tokens in the pipeline.
