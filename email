Thanks for confirming the Cognos namespace is “Azure” and that the service account CMarksSS01@intra.dhs.ca.gov is a Cognos Administrator.

Our pipeline can authenticate to MotioCI (OK), but the Cognos step in deploy fails because we don’t yet have a supported non-interactive authentication method for the service account.

MotioCI supports only:

Username/Password + namespace, or

CAM Passport ID (Cognos session token)

Could you please enable one of the following so we can proceed?

Option A – Username/Password (preferred)

Provide a password for CMarksSS01@intra.dhs.ca.gov.

Ensure MFA is exempted for this account (non-interactive automation).

Confirm the exact namespace string is Azure (we will set --namespaceId "Azure").

Option B – CAM Passport (API)

Provide the API endpoint and request format to obtain a CAM Passport for this service account non-interactively (no MFA).

Include any required headers, body, and the token lifetime/expiry so we can refresh it in Jenkins.

If neither is feasible with the Azure namespace, we can use a dedicated automation account in a Cognos namespace that supports password authentication (no MFA), with the necessary permissions to deploy.

Once one of the above is in place, the current pipeline will work end-to-end.

Thank you!
