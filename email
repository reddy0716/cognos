Subject: Request to Enable Service Account for Cognos Deployments via MotioCI

Hi [Admin Team],

I am working on automating Cognos deployments through MotioCI.
The MotioCI authentication (API token) is working fine, but the pipeline is failing during the deploy step with the error:

DEPLOYMENT_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED: failed to authenticate to instance with ID [X]


This happens when MotioCI tries to log into the target Cognos instance (DEV/TEST and PROD) using the service account.

Could you please help confirm the following for the service account CMarksSS01@intra.dhs.ca.gov:

Namespace ID:

What is the exact namespaceId we should use for DEV/TEST and for PROD?

(Is it Azure AD, AzureAD, or something else? Case and spaces matter.)

Account Status:

Ensure this service account is enabled, password is valid (not expired), and no MFA/interactive login is required.

Confirm it can log in directly to the Cognos portal in both environments.

Permissions:

Does the service account have the required Cognos roles/permissions to perform deployments via MotioCI for project Demo?

If not, can you assign the minimal roles needed?

CAM Passport (if required):

If our environment requires a CAM Passport token instead of username/password for automation, can you provide the correct way to generate a service-account CAM Passport ID for CMarksSS01@intra.dhs.ca.gov?

Once this account is verified for Cognos login in DEV/TEST and PROD, the pipeline should be able to complete deployments automatically.

Thank you for your support. Please let me know if you need logs or the full pipeline error output.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
