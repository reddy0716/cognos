Hi MotioCI Team,

I wanted to let you know that the deployment was successfully executed.
I have updated the pipeline to dynamically generate both the AuthToken and CamPassportID, and used them in the deploy command — the promotion from DEV/TEST → PROD completed successfully.

Previously, the CamPassportID was being generated with the “CAM” prefix, which caused an error during deployment. I’ve implemented a fix to strip that prefix, and everything is now working as expected.

Thank you for your time and support in reviewing the permissions and helping identify the root cause. I really appreciate your assistance throughout this process.
If you’d like, I can share a detailed reference of the steps we followed to achieve this successful deployment.

Best regards,
Srinivas Reddy
