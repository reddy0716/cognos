Hi Team,

We successfully completed a POC to automate the MotioCI–Cognos deployment process by dynamically generating both the X-Auth Token and CAMPassportId (Session Key) within the Jenkins pipeline.

The X-Auth Token is generated from the MotioCI URL using the API key and instance ID, enabling access to both DEV/TEST and PROD instances simultaneously.

The Session Key (CAMPassportId) is retrieved specifically for the PROD instance using its instance ID and API key, based on parameters provided by the IBM Cognos team.

Both credentials are then dynamically injected into the deploy stage, allowing automated promotions without manual token or passport entry.

The POC successfully validated the dynamic authentication and automated deployment flow from DEV/TEST → PROD.

Next Step:
We’ll coordinate with the Cognos Admin team to understand all deployment scenarios — including folder promotions, individual report movements, and manual end-to-end deployment activities — and work toward fully automating these processes through MotioCI and Jenkins.
